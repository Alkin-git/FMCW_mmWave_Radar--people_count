1) This is a MATLAB based FMCW RF Radar Simulator. No matlab tool box is involve.
2) It generates FMCW radar signal data of multiple people in a room. 
3) Your can try develop your radar data processing algorithm base on this simulator.
4) As a charllenge, can you develope your algorithm to detect the number of people.
5) Run main_multi_target.m in matlab to start trying out.
